This was a hard hack. We did our best. Our vision is making decentralized system that unites any realworld devices and peoples who want to get services from them. We developed system for remote printer control here. Code for printer is placed in cps folder. It creates websocket server that can be accessed by web panel. Unfortunately we weren't smart enough to understand everything in difficult TON Payments documentation and example, so some parts are few raw. Anyway, we think this is nice first try using TON for making prototype of something useful and scalable.
